📊 Movie Data Analysis with Pandas
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information on top-rated movies. The analysis was done using Python and Pandas, and includes both statistical exploration and data visualization. The key steps I performed are as follows:

✅ Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.

📈 Generated descriptive statistics for the budget of all movies in the dataset.

🎬 Identified how many top-rated movies produced in the United States have a PG-13 rating.

🌍 Checked if any top-rated movies from 2014 were not produced in the United States.

🎭 Calculated the percentage of top-rated movies that belong to:
Only 1 genre, Only 2 genres, Only 3 genres

💵 Converted both the budget and gross earnings columns from raw dollars to millions of dollars, rounded down to 3 decimal places (e.g., 192,345,273 → 192.345).

💰 Computed the profit (gross - budget) for each movie and listed the top 10 most profitable movies, sorted from highest to lowest.

👨‍🎤 Extracted a unique, alphabetically sorted list of all actors (by first name) who starred in top-rated movies.

🌟 Identified the top 3 actors who appeared in the most top-rated movies.

📊 Created a data visualization showing the number of top-rated movies produced by each country, and found the country with the highest production count.
